🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning
A machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious. This project showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.

📌 Project Highlights
✅ Utilizes the CIC-IDS2017 dataset

✅ Efficient preprocessing of raw CSV flows

✅ Binary classification: Benign vs Malicious

✅ Implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with modular code design

✅ Built with pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn

✅ Ready to extend for multi-class or real-time detection

📊 Dataset Overview
Name: CIC-IDS2017

Source: Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (UNB)

Format: Flow-based .csv files generated by CICFlowMeter

Labels: Multiple attack types (e.g., DDoS, PortScan) — grouped here into:
🔵 Benign
🔴 Malicious

📥 Getting the Data
Note: Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Download GeneratedLabelledFlows.zip from:
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

Extract to this path:
data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/

You should see 8 CSV files representing multiple days of traffic.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Install required packages:

nginx

pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your CSV files inside:

kotlin

data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/
Run preprocessing (inside preprocess.ipynb):

python

import pandas as pd
import glob

path = "data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/"
csv_files = glob.glob(path + "*.csv")
df = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, low_memory=False, encoding="ISO-8859-1") for f in csv_files], ignore_index=True)
Train your model using train.ipynb

🧪 Evaluation
Includes standard classification metrics:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Example result:


    precision    recall  f1-score   support

      Benign       0.98      0.99      0.99     42000
    Malicious     0.97      0.95      0.96     28000

    accuracy                          0.98     70000
💡 Future Improvements
