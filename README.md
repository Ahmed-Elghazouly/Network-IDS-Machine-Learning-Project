# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious. This project showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Utilizes the [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) dataset
- ✅ Efficient preprocessing of raw CSV flows
- ✅ Binary classification: `Benign` vs `Malicious`
- ✅ Implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with modular code design
- ✅ Built with `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `scikit-learn`
- ✅ Ready to extend for multi-class or real-time detection

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Name:** CIC-IDS2017
- **Source:** Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity ([UNB](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html))
- **Format:** Flow-based `.csv` files generated by CICFlowMeter
- **Labels:** Multiple attack types (e.g., DDoS, PortScan) — grouped here into:
  - 🔵 `Benign`
  - 🔴 `Malicious`

## 📥 Getting the Data

> Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repo.

1. Download `GeneratedLabelledFlows.zip` from:  
   📎 https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

2. Extract to this path:
```

data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/

````

3. You should see 8 CSV files representing multiple days of traffic.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. 📦 Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. 📁 Place your CSV files inside:

```
data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/
```

3. 🧹 Run preprocessing:

```python
# From within preprocess.ipynb
import pandas as pd
import glob

path = "data/GeneratedLabelledFlows/TrafficLabelling/"
csv_files = glob.glob(path + "*.csv")
df = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, low_memory=False, encoding="ISO-8859-1") for f in csv_files], ignore_index=True)
```

4. 🧠 Train your model using `train.ipynb`

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

Includes standard classification metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

> Example result:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

      Benign       0.98      0.99      0.99     42000
    Malicious     0.97      0.95      0.96     28000

    accuracy                          0.98     70000
```

## 💡 Future Improvements

* 🔄 Real-time PCAP to Flow processing
* 🧠 Multi-class classification (e.g., detect attack types)
* 📉 Dimensionality reduction (PCA, mutual information)
* ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
* ☁️ Integration with cloud dashboards (e.g., Grafana)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas / NumPy
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
